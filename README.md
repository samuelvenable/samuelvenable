ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @samuelvenable

- I am a semi-major contributor to [Boost Process v2](https://github.com/boostorg/process); I added many features regarding the retrieval of foreign process info.
- I love to develop cross-platform desktop-targeted libraries and tools in mostly C++ for low-level operating system dev.
- I permissively license all source code I release whenever I am authorized to do so, because that is what real freedom is like.
- I enjoy developing cross-platform desktop-targeted extensions for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) in mostly C++.
- I maintain my own game engine, named [STIGMA](https://github.com/samuelvenable/stigma-dev), (the name of the software is an inside-joke).
