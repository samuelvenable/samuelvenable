ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @samuelvenable

- I am a semi-major contributor to [Boost Process v2](https://github.com/boostorg/process); I added many features regarding the retrieval of foreign process information.
- I love to develop cross-platform desktop-targeted libraries and tools in mostly C++ for low-level operating system development.
- I permissively license all source code I release whenever I am authorized to do so, because that is what real freedom is like.
- I maintain my own game engine, named [stigma-dev](https://github.com/samuelvenable/stigma-dev) (the name of the software is an inside-joke).
- I enjoy developing cross-platform desktop-targeted extensions for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) in mostly C++.
