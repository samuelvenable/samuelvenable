ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @samuelvenable

- I permissively license all source code I release whenever authorized, because that is real software freedom.
- I am a semi-major contributor to [Boost Process v2](https://github.com/boostorg/process); I wrote ways to access foreign, non-child, process info.
- I love to develop cross-platform desktop-targeted libraries and software in mostly C++ for low-level OS-dev.
- I enjoy developing and maintaining cross-platform desktop-targeted extensions for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) in mostly C++.
- I maintain my own game engine written in C++, named [STIGMA](https://github.com/samuelvenable/stigma-dev), (the name of the software is an inside-joke).
- I love the [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org) project and the community surrounding it in their helpful and friendly [Discord](https://discord.com) server.
- Very occasionally now I develop my own indie games, (this used to be my number-one hobby).
